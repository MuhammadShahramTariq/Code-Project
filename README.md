## Programs Included

1. **Average Calculator**
   - Inputs: Obtained Marks, Total Marks
   - Output: Average (OB/TM)
   - Concepts: Variables, Division, `cout.precision()`

2. **Compound Interest Calculator**
   - Inputs: Principal (P), Compounding Frequency (n), Time (t), Interest Rate (r)
   - Formula: A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
   - Concepts: `<math.h>`, `pow()` function

3. **Power Function Program**
   - Inputs: x, y
   - Output: x^y
   - Concepts: Math library, Exponentiation

4. **Simple Billing System**
   - Inputs: Product prices (3 products), Decimal precision
   - Output: Detailed bill with `showpoint`, precision control
   - Concepts: I/O formatting, Addition, `noshowpoint`

5. **Bitwise Operator Demonstration**
   - Operations: AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), Right Shift (`>>`)
   - Concepts: Bitwise operations on integers

6. **Savings Balance Simulation**
   - Initial Balance = 1000
   - Operations: Deposit, Withdrawal, Add 5% Interest
   - Concepts: Compound updates using `+=` and `-=`

## Purpose

- To learn **input/output operations** with `cin` and `cout`.
- To practice **arithmetic operations**, mathematical functions, and precision formatting.
- To understand **bitwise operations**.
- To simulate real-world problems like billing and saving accounts.

## How to Run

1. Install a C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC).
2. Compile any program, for example:
press F11 or you will see compile option in dev c++
